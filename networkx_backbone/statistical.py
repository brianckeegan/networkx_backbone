Statistical backbone extraction methods.

These methods evaluate edge significance using hypothesis testing against
a null model. Each method computes a p-value (or score) for every edge,
which can then be filtered using functions in :mod:`networkx_backbone.filters`.

def disparity_filter(G, weight="weight", signed=False):
    r"""Compute disparity filter p-values for each edge.

    The disparity filter [1]_ tests whether an edge's weight is
    statistically significant compared to a null model where each node's
    total strength is uniformly distributed across its edges.

    For each node *u* with degree *k_u* and strength *s_u*, the normalised
    weight of edge (u, v) is ``p_uv = w_uv / s_u``.  Under the null the
    probability of observing a normalised weight >= p_uv is::

        alpha_uv = (1.0 - p_uv) ** (k_u - 1)

    For an undirected edge the p-value is the *minimum* of the values
    computed from each endpoint.  For a directed edge (u, v) the test is run
    from the source's outgoing links (out-strength and out-degree of *u*) and
    from the target's incoming links (in-strength and in-degree of *v*), and
    the p-value is the minimum of the two, following [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph or networkx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX graph.
    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge attribute key for weights.  All weights must be positive.
    signed : bool, optional (default=False)
        If ``True``, run a two-tailed test: the stored p-value becomes two-sided
        and a ``"sign"`` edge attribute marks significantly strong (``+1``)
        versus significantly weak (``-1``) edges.

    Returns
    -------
    H : graph
        A copy of *G* (same type) with ``"disparity_pvalue"`` added as an
        edge attribute (and ``"sign"`` when ``signed=True``).

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If any edge has a non-positive, non-finite, or missing weight.
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If *G* is a multigraph.  Collapse parallel edges first with
        :func:`~networkx_backbone.multigraph_to_weighted`.

    See Also
    --------
    threshold_filter : Keep edges whose p-value is below a threshold.
    marginal_likelihood_filter : Null model that uses both endpoints jointly.

    Notes
    -----
    An endpoint of degree 1 cannot reject the null model, so it contributes a
    p-value of 1 and the edge's p-value comes from the other endpoint.

def noise_corrected_filter(G, weight="weight"):
    r"""Compute noise-corrected edge significance scores.

    Models each edge weight as the outcome of a binomial process in which
    the total network weight *W* is distributed according to the endpoint
    strengths, following the null model of Coscia & Neffke [1]_.  The
    expected weight of edge (u, v) is::

        E[w_uv] = (s_u * s_v) / W

    The score measures how many standard deviations the observed weight
    lies above the expectation (a z-score).  Higher scores indicate
    more significant edges.

    .. note::

       This is a simplified, frequentist version of the noise-corrected
       backbone.  It does not implement the Bayesian posterior variance
       (delta-method) estimate of the original paper, so scores differ from
       the reference implementation, especially for low-strength nodes.
       See the project roadmap.

    For directed graphs, out-strength of *u* and in-strength of *v*
    are used.

@not_implemented_for("multigraph")
def marginal_likelihood_filter(G, weight="weight", signed=False):
    r"""Compute marginal likelihood p-values for each edge.

    The marginal likelihood filter [1]_ treats an integer edge weight as a
    count of unit edges.  Under the null model each of the *T* unit edges
    picks its two endpoints independently with probability proportional to
    their strengths, so the weight of the pair (u, v) is binomial,
    ``B(T, p_uv)``, with

    .. math::

        T = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i s_i, \qquad p_{uv} = \frac{s_u s_v}{2 T^2}

    for undirected graphs, and :math:`T = \sum_i s^{out}_i`,
    :math:`p_{uv} = s^{out}_u s^{in}_v / T^2` for directed graphs.  The
    p-value is the upper tail :math:`P(X \geq w_{uv})`.  This null preserves
    the strength sequence in expectation and is symmetric in *u* and *v*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph or networkx.DiGraph

    r"""Compute ECM (Enhanced Configuration Model) p-values.

    The ECM [1]_ is the maximum-entropy ensemble of integer-weighted graphs
    whose expected degree *and* strength sequences equal the observed ones.
    Each node gets two Lagrange multipliers, :math:`x_i > 0` and
    :math:`0 < y_i < 1`.  The probability that *i* and *j* are linked and
    the distribution of the weight of an existing link are

    .. math::

        p_{ij} = \frac{x_i x_j y_i y_j}{1 - y_i y_j + x_i x_j y_i y_j},
        \qquad
        P(w_{ij} \geq w) = p_{ij} (y_i y_j)^{w - 1}, \; w \geq 1,

    and the p-value of an observed link is :math:`P(w_{ij} \geq w)`.  The
    multipliers are found by maximizing the likelihood (L-BFGS-B with the
    analytic gradient), which is equivalent to solving
    :math:`\sum_j p_{ij} = k_i` and :math:`\sum_j \langle w_{ij}\rangle = s_i`.

    For directed graphs, each node has separate out- and in-multipliers that
    reproduce its out- and in-degree and strength.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph or networkx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX graph.  Weights are rounded to the nearest integer, so the
        method is meant for count data.
    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge attribute key for weights.  All weights must be positive.
    max_iter : int, optional (default=1000)
        Maximum number of solver iterations.
    tol : float, optional (default=1e-6)
        Tolerance on the largest relative error of the reproduced degrees and
        strengths.  A :class:`RuntimeWarning` is raised if it is not met.

    Returns
    -------
    H : graph
        A copy of *G* (same type) with ``"ecm_pvalue"`` edge attribute.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If any edge has a non-positive, non-finite, or missing weight.
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If *G* is a multigraph.

    Warns
    -----
    RuntimeWarning
        If the solver does not reproduce the degree and strength sequences to
        within ``tol``.

    See Also
    --------
    marginal_likelihood_filter : Binomial null that fixes only strengths.

    Notes
    -----
    Self-loops are ignored when fitting the null model and get a p-value
    of 1.  The fit costs :math:`O(n^2)` memory and time per iteration.

def lans_filter(G, weight="weight", signed=False):
    r"""Compute LANS (Locally Adaptive Network Sparsification) p-values.

    LANS [1]_ is a nonparametric method that makes no distributional
    assumptions.  For each edge (u, v), it computes the fraction of
    edges at node *u* (and node *v*) that have weight <= w_uv --- the
    empirical CDF value.  The edge p-value is one minus the maximum
    of the two eCDF values (so lower p means more significant).

    For directed graphs, the source node's out-edges and the target node's
    in-edges are both used, and the edge p-value is computed from the more
    significant of the two sides.

    The p-value is ``1 - F(w)``, where ``F`` is the empirical CDF of the
    node's weights.  The strongest link of each node therefore gets a p-value
    of 0, and so does the only link of a degree-1 node.  LANS always keeps
    these links; this is how the method guarantees that no node becomes
    isolated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph or networkx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX graph.
    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge attribute key for weights.  All weights must be positive.
    signed : bool, optional (default=False)
        If ``True``, run a two-tailed test and add a ``"sign"`` edge attribute
        (``+1`` significantly strong, ``-1`` significantly weak).

    Returns
    -------
    H : graph
        A copy of *G* (same type) with ``"lans_pvalue"`` edge attribute.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If any edge has a non-positive, non-finite, or missing weight.
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If *G* is a multigraph.

def multiple_linkage_analysis(G, alpha=0.05, weight="weight"):
    r"""Extract a backbone using Multiple Linkage Analysis (MLA).

    Selects edges whose weights are unusually high relative to the other
    edges of their endpoints, using the edge-level empirical-CDF p-values of
    :func:`lans_filter` and keeping edges with p-value <= ``alpha``.  This
    follows the netbone [2]_ implementation.

    .. note::

       The original multiple linkage analysis of Van Nuffel et al. [1]_
       instead compares each node's sorted link weights with a sequence of
       ideal "dominance" distributions and keeps the links of the best fit.
       That procedure is not implemented here yet; see the project roadmap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph or networkx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX graph.
    alpha : float, optional (default=0.05)
        Significance threshold in [0, 1].
    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge attribute key for weights. All weights must be positive.

    Returns
    -------
    H : graph
        A copy of *G* with ``"lans_pvalue"``, ``"mla_pvalue"``, and boolean
        ``"mla_keep"`` edge attributes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``alpha`` is outside [0, 1].
    NetworkXError
        If any edge has a non-positive, non-finite, or missing weight.
