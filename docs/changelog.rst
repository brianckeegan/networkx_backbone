Unreleased (0.2.0)
------------------

This release adds hypergraph backbones and the remaining Backbone 3.0
features. It also fixes many correctness problems found in a full code review
that checked every method against its paper. **Several methods now return
different results**; see *Changes in results* below. Remaining review findings
are tracked in the :doc:`roadmap` and in GitHub issues #9-#31.

**Supported versions (breaking)**

- Requires **Python 3.12 or newer** and **NetworkX 3.4 or newer**, matching
  NetworkX's own support window. The optional dependency minimums now match
  NetworkX's too: NumPy 2.2, SciPy 1.15, Matplotlib 3.10. A CI job tests
  these minimums exactly.

**New features**

- Hypergraph module: the parameter-free MDL hypergraph backbone (Kirkley et
  al., 2026) with ``"edge"``, ``"node"``, and ``"auto"`` optimizers;
  statistically validated hypergraphs and cores (SVH/SVC); maximal
  hyperedges, order filtering, s-components, and intersection graphs.
- ``hypergraph_io``: ``hypergraph_to_bipartite``, the HIF interchange format,
  and adapters for xgi, HyperNetX, HypergraphX, and HAT.
- Backbone 3.0 parity: multiple-testing correction
  (:func:`~networkx_backbone.adjust_pvalues`, ``threshold_filter(mtc=...)``),
  signed backbones (``signed=True``), and SDSM-EC edge constraints.
- ``backbone_from_projection(mtc=...)``; ``sdsm(pvalue_method=...)``;
  ``fdsm(burn_in=..., thin=...)``; ``bicm(tol=..., max_iter=...)``.
- ``seed=`` on ``modularity_backbone``, ``sparsify``, and ``compare_graphs``.
- ``multigraph_to_weighted(aggregate=...)``, which can sum, average, or take
  the max/min of parallel-edge weights.
- ``local_path_index(weight=...)``; a ``h_bridge`` attribute from
  ``h_backbone``; ``statistically_validated_cores(max_groups=...)``.

- New :func:`~networkx_backbone.describe_backbone`: methods-section text and
  citations for a backbone, in text, Markdown, or BibTeX; the counterpart of
  Backbone 3.0's ``narrative`` (#23). It is backed by one method-to-BibTeX
  registry that covers every public scorer, and a test enforces that coverage.
- Added ``CITATION.cff``.
- New tutorial, "Validating a backbone": multiple-testing correction,
  ``compare_backbones``, consensus, signed backbones, and reporting (#27).
- ``glab_filter`` now supports directed graphs using the out- and
  in-involvement of Zhang et al. (2014), Section 2.3 (#12). On a symmetric
  ``DiGraph`` it gives the undirected p-values.

**Changes in results (bug fixes)**

- ``sparsify(umst=True)`` now adds the union of all minimum spanning trees
  (Hamann et al., 2016) instead of one arbitrary spanning forest, so tied
  scores no longer make the result depend on node order (#32). The union is
  added whenever ``umst=True``, not only when filtering split a component.

The Les Misérables counts below are edges kept at the documented threshold.
Davis counts are significant woman-woman pairs at alpha = 0.05.

- ``ecm_filter``: the solver never converged and every p-value was about 0,
  so every edge was kept (254 of 254). It now fits the ECM by maximum
  likelihood and uses the correct geometric tail; it keeps 72 edges and warns
  if the fit does not converge.
- ``marginal_likelihood_filter``: now uses Dianati's null,
  :math:`B(T, s_is_j/2T^2)`. The old formula depended on the order nodes were
  added. Les Misérables: 70 -> 126 edges.
- ``glab_filter``: now uses per-node shortest-path involvement and
  :math:`(1-I_{ij})^{(k_i-1)^c}` (Zhang et al., 2014) instead of global edge
  betweenness. Les Misérables: 5 -> 56 edges.
- ``disparity_filter`` on directed graphs also tests the target's incoming
  links.
- ``lans_filter`` on directed graphs also tests the target's incoming links
  (#11, contributed by @bfs2021 in #34).
- ``bicm``/``sdsm``: the BiCM is now actually fitted rather than
  approximated with Chung-Lu, and p-values use exact Poisson-binomial tails
  (or RNA). SDSM-EC refits on the free cells. Davis: 3 -> 0 pairs.
- ``fdsm``: the null now preserves degrees (a curveball chain; previously
  197 of 200 samples broke the margins), and p-values are
  ``(count + 1) / (trials + 1)``. Davis: about 10 -> 5 pairs.
- ``fixedfill`` and ``fixedcol`` use their exact null distributions.
- ``backbone_from_projection`` and ``backbone()`` now threshold ``sdsm`` and
  ``fdsm`` at ``alpha``, as they already did for the other models.
- ``lspar``/``sparsify`` and ``local_degree``: each node ranks its own edges
  (Satuluri et al., 2011; Lindner et al., 2015), and ties are kept together.
  Les Misérables: 136 -> 174 (LSpar) and 135 -> 91 (local degree).
- ``h_backbone`` follows Zhang et al. (2018): unweighted betweenness on the
  full graph, normalized by N. When h = 0 no edges are kept. Les Misérables:
  22 -> 18.
- ``high_salience_skeleton`` splits credit among tied shortest paths, so
  saliences sum to n - 1.
- ``metric_backbone`` uses a relative tolerance; ``ultrametric_backbone`` no
  longer crashes on self-loops.
- Proximity indices exclude self-loops from neighborhoods and use out-degree
  for directed graphs.
- ``doubly_stochastic_filter`` warns when Sinkhorn-Knopp does not converge and
  no longer accepts a loose convergence check.
- ``reachability`` counts directed reachability correctly;
  ``compare_backbones`` forwards ``weight`` to every measure that accepts it.
- ``adjust_pvalues`` keeps NaN as NaN and excludes it from the number of tests
  (as R's ``p.adjust`` does), instead of making it significant.

**API conventions (NetworkX compatibility)**

- Every scorer raises ``NetworkXNotImplemented`` for multigraphs (use
  :func:`~networkx_backbone.multigraph_to_weighted` first), and
  ``NetworkXError`` for missing, non-positive, NaN, or infinite weights.
- Bipartite functions accept generators for ``agent_nodes``, reject agent sets
  that are not one side of the bipartition, and raise ``AmbiguousSolution``
  when the partition cannot be inferred.
- Filters keep graph, node, and edge attributes and multigraph keys.
  ``fraction_filter`` ignores unscored elements, and ``consensus_backbone``
  works with node labels of mixed types and returns edges in a deterministic
  order.
- Functions that used a hardcoded ``seed=42`` now default to ``seed=None``,
  following NetworkX. Pass a seed for reproducible results.

**Performance**

- Vectorized ``sdsm``/``fixed*``/``fdsm`` (``sdsm`` on 400x300: 6.4 s ->
  0.36 s); MDL ``"node"`` optimizer with a lazy heap (m = 2000: 8.3 s ->
  0.47 s); vectorized SVC p-values.

**Infrastructure and documentation**

- CI on every push and pull request: ruff lint and format checks, tests and
  doctests on Python 3.12-3.14, a job pinned to the oldest supported
  versions, and a NetworkX-only job that checks the optional dependencies
  stay optional. Test coverage is 97%.
- New :doc:`roadmap`; full numpydoc sections for the bipartite, hypergraph,
  and structural APIs; corrected citations (Van Nuffel et al., 2010; Lü et
  al., 2009; Lindner et al., 2015); the docs version is taken from the package
  metadata.
