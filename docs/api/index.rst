API Reference
=============

Complete API documentation for backbone functions across 10 modules.
API examples are standardized on ``nx.les_miserables_graph()`` for
non-bipartite methods and ``nx.davis_southern_women_graph()`` for
bipartite methods.
Each module page includes Sphinx Gallery links showing score-then-filter
visualizations for the listed functions.
Each function entry includes complexity information (time/space), with
an aggregate summary in :doc:`../user_guide/complexity`.
